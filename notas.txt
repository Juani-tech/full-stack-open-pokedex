How do you keep your main branch green then? Avoid committing any changes directly to the main branch. Instead, commit your code on a branch based on the freshest possible version of the main branch. Once you think the branch is ready to be merged into the main you create a GitHub Pull Request (also referred to as PR).



## 9, d - Keeping green

All the workflows we looked at so far were triggered by commits to the main branch. To make the workflow run for each pull request we would have to update the trigger part of the workflow. We use the "pull_request" trigger for branch "main" (our main branch) and limit the trigger to events "opened" and "synchronize". Basically, this means, that the workflow will run when a PR into the main branch is opened or updated.

```on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    types: [opened, synchronize]
